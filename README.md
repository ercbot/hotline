  - ðŸ”œ CLI interface for easy configuration and control

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version recommended)
- OpenAI Key (currently only supports OpenAI API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ercbot/hotline.git
   cd hotline
   ```

2. Set up your API key:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the client with:

```
cargo run
```

The client will automatically connect to the AI API and start recording audio from your default input device.
